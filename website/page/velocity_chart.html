                            Our velocity graph shows that for both iteration one and two we over-committed. Our group was very ambitious with what we wanted to accomplish but it was difficult to complete all the tasks in time. Our iteration two commitment increased by so much because some of the tasks that were not completed in iteration one then were pushed to iteration two. Although for both iterations we were not able to complete all the desired tasks we did improve on how much actual time we completed. For iteration three we were able to complete all tasks and even had additional features added that we originally were not planning on having done until a later iteration. We committed a few more days than what we originally estimated but all at the expense of having our final app up to our groups standards.
