We did a really good job at helping one another when we needed assistance or explaining how we wanted our app to be designed. We struggled a little at first in iteration one with communicating with one another about how we were going to commit the project with so many of us working on it at once. After iteration oneâ€™s retrospective, we decided to assign tasks that would not require us to rely on one person finishing their tasks in order for the next person to start their tasks. We definitely saw improvement from iteration one to two but agreed that we need to make sure that tasks that rely on one another are done at the beginning of the iteration. What we thought would be the basic features of having a language list to choose from, lessons, and flashcards turned out to be a lot more difficult. We originally thought we would be able to complete the basic functioning of our app in iteration one but now we are just now finishing it in iteration three. This was a surprise for us because we did not realize how much work went into writing good tests, setting up a database, and collaborating on one project.</p>
