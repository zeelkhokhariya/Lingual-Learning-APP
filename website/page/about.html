                                    <p class="service-tab-p">Lingual's user base specifically applies to native English speaking adults. The reason for this specific scope, is that depending on your native language, how you learn a language and how easy a particular language is to learn will vary. For example, a native French speaker may have an easier time learning Spanish because both French and Spanish belong to the Romance language family. In other words, they are both derived from Vulgar Latin and as a result they have many similar grammatical structures and words. Another example would be that a native Japanese speaker might have an easier time learning Chinese since they are already experienced in memorizing many different characters for their own writing system. Lingual explains lessons and highlights common difficulties for the user's target language in a way that native English speakers will best understand. Secondly, the skills and resources a person uses to learn a new language differs between adults and children. Lingual chose to focus on adults (18+), and therefore also tailors its learning environment to this age group. Lessons are explained at the high-level, and include details, nuances, and other uncommon factors in their explanation not usually taught to a younger age group since on average, they have less learning capacity and skills compared to adults. Furthermore, it should be noted that Lingual is not intended for elderly adults (70+). This is due to the fact that at that age, cognitive and memory-related problems are more common which might interfere with Lingual's approach to learning. Within the capacity of native English speaking adults, Lingual can still be applied to a wide variety of users such as: a post-secondary student studying a second language, someone who travelled to a country that speaks a different language for pleasure or work-related reasons, someone wanting to learn a new language while in quarantine, or a person that wants to learn a relative's native language.

                                        <br />The default interface of the app is the home page which shows a list of languages currently available. The user can select a language by clicking on the icon of the desired language.
                                        <br />2.Languages
                                        <br />Lingual currently has 5 different language options including: French, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Spanish.
                                        <br />2 of these languages (French and Japanese) actually contain further content for the user to explore in the form of Lessons and Flashcards
                                        <br />3.Lessons
                                        <br />Lessons for a language are displayed on the interface once a user selects a particular language
                                        <br />Lessons are comprised from a single or multiple modules such as some Text, a Quiz, and a Word List.
                                        <br />A Text part of a lesson contains some paragraphs of a written explanation of a certain language feature
                                        <br />A Quiz part of a lesson contains some quiz questions about a certain language feature
                                        <br />A Word or character list part of a lesson displays a list of words that the user can study
                                        <br />The French language currently contains 3 lessons and Japanese contains 5
                                        <br />4.Flashcards
                                        <br />Flashcards are available in the app for user's to study a certain aspect of their language
                                        <br />Every flashcard contains a 'date' which is used to determine whether or not the flashcard is currently in the user's study queue
                                        <br />If the flashcard contains a 'date' in the past, the flashcard is available for the user to study, otherwise the 'date' is in the future meaning the flashcard has not yet been unlocked
                                        <br />When a user is studying their flashcards and they answer one correctly it is removed from the queue. If it is answered incorrectly, it will be placed back into the queue for them to try again later.
                                        <br />Flashcards for lessons become unlocked immediately after completion of the lesson
                                        <br />Flashcards can also be readily accessible without being combined to a lesson. The French language contains this feature.
                                        <br />5.Dictionary Lookup
                                        <br />Each of the functional languages in the app contain a dictionary lookup feature.
                                        <br />When a user hovers over or selects some text, an icon of 3 dots will appear which they can press to look up their selection in an external browser
                                        <br />Each language has its own specific dictionary
                                        <br />6.Notifications
                                        <br />The system contains daily notifications to remind the user to practice their language
                                        <br />The notification event takes place every day at "8:00am"
                                        <br />7.System Tests
                                        <br />Unit, Integration, and Acceptance tests are categorized and performed
                                        <br />Unit tests include coverage for all layers of the project
