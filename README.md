# **Lingual** â€“ A Language Learning App

## Purpose
Lingual is a language learning application intended to teach native English speakers
a second language of their choice. This is done through customized lessons and review
exercises for each language. 

This interface was made for the purpose of completing a term-long team project for 
the computer science course 
['Software Engineering I'](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/courses-2/)
at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/) for Winter 2021.
